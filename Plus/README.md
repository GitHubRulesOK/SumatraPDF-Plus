This is a collection of files intended to be used with (or without) SumatraPDF by place in a Subfolder called "Plus".

They are mainly Proof Of Concept's (PoC's) and thus may have bugs or customisation needs based on your own use but provided with the aim to be a companion for various related tasks

Most are self documented so read the contents before running to edit or change for your own usage.  
Some may depend on other resources and may need an online connection to fetch 3rd party apps.
